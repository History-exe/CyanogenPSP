Disclaimer:
=================
CyanogenPSP is in no way affilated with Cyanogen INC or CyanogenMod. It is purely a fan made project that doesn't make use of the Android source code in any way.


About:
=================
This is a program that allows you to do everything a regular PSP can do with a little more interesting features, displaying them with an entirely different UI. This is a project built from ground up, which doesn't use any code from the Android SDK. Its purpose is similar to "iR Shell", but is based on a modernized UI inspired by CyanogenMod, Android. This program will never allow you to run android apps.
