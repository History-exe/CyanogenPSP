# CyanogenPSP 4.0 

This is the lollipop designed version of my PSP Project previously known as CyanoPSP. The compiling instructions are the same
as CyanoPSP's.

For now all it has is a 'materialized' look and is based on the latest changes from CyanoPSP 3.1.
It's not ready for release just yet since some things are sitll missing, and also not 'materialized'.
