CyanogenPSP Stable
=================

This is a program that allows you to do everything a PSP can do with a little more handy features, but with a whole different UI. This isn't a port of CyanogenMod for android, it's a project created from scratch. It's purpose is similar to that of "iR Shell", but has a UI inspired by CyanogenMod, Android. It will never allow you to run android apps, the psp system doesn't have the hardware capabilities to run android.
