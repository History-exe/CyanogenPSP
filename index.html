<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to CyanogenPSP</h3>

<p>You're probably here because you've seen my project appear on my YouTube channel or my Google+, or one of the PSP hacking scene sites where I'd normally hang out. I've been maintaining this project for a year a few months now and by that, you should be able to conculde that I am an Android Enthusiast. My aim here is not to provide something that's way beyond the PSP's limitations, but to provide an altervative to a modernized UI design. This project pretty much lets you do anything a regular PSP with Custom Firmware would do, along with some nifty features all built-in one package. Below you will see the main features of this project.</p>

<p>You're here cause you're probably tired of using the XMB, and you want expereince a new UI. It's time to dust of your PSP, and complement it with Android's latest and greatest design - The Android Lollipop UI. This UI mimics the lollipop design head to toe, without missing one pixel of detail.</p>

<p>From changing your wallpaper to using your own custom font! CyanogenPSP slightly mocks the well-known theme manager in CyanogenMod, by offering its minimal cutomization. You can toggle the gameboot, the boot animation, the day/night widget, and even one of android's well known features - the expanded desktop. While it doesn't do exactly what the Android's well known custom rom feature does, it offers its "PSP version" that behaves and acts pretty much the same.</p>
